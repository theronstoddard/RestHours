# RestHours
## Restaurant Locator Application

This is a sample C# project used to demonstrate good code practices, such as the single responsiblity principle, dependency inversion, error handling, logging, etc.

The applicaiton allows users to search a static database of restaurants for those open at a specific time. When running the application it will prompt for a weekday and then a time to search for available restaurants. After entering a desired day and time, a list of available restaurants will be displayed. You can continute to search for restaurants until you quit the program by entering 'q'. Just follow the screen prompts.

Have fun!
