# RestHours
## Restaurant Locator Application

This is a sample C# project used to demonstrate good code practices, such as the single responsiblity principle, dependency inversion, open-closed principle, unit tests, error handling, logging, etc.

The applicaiton allows users to search a static database of restaurants for those open at a specific time. When running the application it will prompt for a weekday and then a time to search for available restaurants. After entering a desired day and time, a list of available restaurants will be displayed. You can continute to search for restaurants until you quit the program by entering 'q'. Just follow the screen prompts.

Each time the application is run a log file named RestaurantLocator.log will be created in the executable directory with significant detals of what the program is doing. If an error occurs, grab the log file and send it to me!

Have fun!
